# Kappel Lab
- lab tagline: Combining high-throughput experiments and computation to decipher sequence-structure-function relationships of RNA, proteins, and their interactions
- understand how RNA and proteins contribute to cellular function and disease-related dysfunction and to design novel functional RNA and protein sequences for therapeutic and biotechnology applications

lab interests
- condensate --> formation, structure, function
- RNA structure and function prediction in cell 

# my interests: 
- ML / RL 
- evolutionary algorithms
- protein / rna structure function prediction
- maybe aptamers? took a look at this paper: [DAPTEV: Deep aptamer evolutionary modelling for COVID-19 drug desigm](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/11/30/2022.11.30.518473.full.pdf)
- drug design?


# Questions for Kalli
- What should I brush up on before starting this project --> her lab is a biochem so should i read up on chemical representations (SMILES etc) or can my project remain more comp bio / ml 
- 
# fellowships
- i want to apply for soros and grfp, ask kalli if she has any thoughts about the grfp project proposal


# personal goals for phd 
1. learn how to conduct research experiments and think critically / problem solve
2. learn to write scientific papers
3. ideally id like to do at least 1 / 2 internships --> i want to work in industry
4. learn to teach / be a good mentor --> i want to TA a couple classes (but I also want to prioritize research and graduate on time)
5. havent decided whether i want to do hardcore ML or more comp bio stuff yet (career) so im not sure if i should focus more on ML conference type papers or more traditional scientific journals
	1. ideally id like to be able to go to 1/2 conferences over the course of the PhD
	2. id like to try at least 1 methods focused project tho
6. 

# project ideas
- connect in vitro rna / protein structure is different from in vivo / on a slide? 
	- maybe look at go terms (	- cellular component ontology (CCO))
	- somethign with structure prediction? 
- context dependent rna function prediction
- function prediction from seq.  and context? 
- what is context? --> substrate? binding proteins? 
- aptamers would be cool to work on
- drug design
- 


# notes from meeting 9/17/25
- project: predict condensate features from sequence 
	- sequences are mostly synthetic --> mutated versions fo natural sequences
	- condenseq allows high throughout experiments for testing for condensate formation of disordered proteins
	- thoughts about how to go about it
		- predicting features sequentially + tagging it back into the input? 
		- 
- notes about condensates and disordered proteins
	- not all disordered proteins form condensates + it's highly concentration dependent
	- most proteins have some disordered regions
	- harder to predict structure
	- disordered protein sequence is conserved by properties ? but not necessarily sequence
- questions? 
	- what is really captured by alphafold embeddings? esm2?
