	- nuclear processes include, but are not limited to, regulation of chromosome structure and maintenance [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R12)–[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R16), DNA replication [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R17)], DNA repair [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R18),[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R19)], transcription [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R20)–[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R24)], RNA processing [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R25),[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R26)], and preribosome assembly [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R27)–[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R30)

- Biomolecular condensates in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells can compartmentalize and concentrate functionally related components. 
	- usingweak, multivalent, and dynamic interactions among proteins and other biopolymers in the absence of a bounding membrane ([Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#F2)) [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R4),[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R5)]. 
	- **weak multivalent interactions** can involve **intrinsically disordered regions** (IDRs) [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R31)], structured modular domains [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R32)], oligomerization domains [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R33)], and other features enabling one protein to engage with multiple proteins simultaneously [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R8)]. 
	- Weak cooperative interactions are thought to facilitate evolutionary change leading to their positive selection in diverse cellular processes [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R34)]. 
	- Most nuclear condensates interact with specific DNA loci, and this imposes some degree of organization for the biomolecular condensates within the nucleus ([Figure 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#F1)).
- Compartmentalization
	- <iframe src="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/figure/F3/" height="1000" width="80%"></iframe>
	- Nucleolus
		- rRNA transcription, processing, and assembly into preribosomes all occur within three distinct domains of the nucleolus, organized to ensure proper division and order of labor [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R30),[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R41)]. RNA polymerase (Pol) I and its associated factors are compartmentalized in one domain of the nucleolar condensate (fibrillar center) with tandem arrays of 45S rRNA genes. Transcribed 45S rRNA is cleaved and processed into rRNA subunits in a second layer (dense fibrillar center) and then assembled into preribosomes in a third outer layer (granular component). Disruption of this spatiotemporal condensate organization leads to cell death
	- Nuclear Speckles
		- dynamic, membraneless organelles within the nucleus of higher eukaryotic cells that function as a reservoir for proteins and RNA involved in gene expression, particularly pre-mRNA splicing
	- Transcription Factors
		- TFs typically consist of a stable structured domain involved in selective DNA binding, and an activation domain consisting of an IDR [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R51)] that weakly interacts with IDRs in cofactors to form dynamic assemblies [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572565/#R21)]. This type of bifunctional protein – one that has a structured domain capable of relatively high-affinity binding to a specific DNA, RNA, or protein sequence, coupled to an IDR or other condensate-promoting domain, is typical of proteins that tether nuclear condensates to specific regions of the genome

- Phase separation is primarily governed by multivalent interactions among tyrosine residues from prion-like domains and arginine residues from RNA-binding domains, which are modulated by negatively charged residues. Glycine residues enhance the fluidity, whereas glutamine and serine residues promote hardening

# Dysregulation of transcriptional condensates in human disease_ mechanisms, biological functions, and open questions
- transcriptional condensates’ refer to dense assemblies on chromatin that concentrate transcription-related molecules, irrespective of their assembly mechanisms or resultant material properties
- Transcriptional condensates: formation and features 
	- Interactions with DNA, locally transcribed RNA, and histones play an important role in positioning condensates at their genomic targets
	- Condensates formed by TFs have been shown to be influenced by the sequence, number, and density of DNA-binding sites in a specific genomic region, with a higher number of binding motifs leading to larger condensates
	- RNA-mediated feedback control mechanism for transcription, where low levels of RNAs produced during transcriptional initiation promote condensate formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulates condensate dissolution
	- condensates formed by chromatin reader proteins also rely on their interactions with specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones.
	- these interactions with local chromatin not only contribute to the locus specificity and size of transcriptional condensates but also facilitate condensation of regulatory proteins on target loci at lower concentrations than required for phase separation
	- network of multivalent homotypic and heterotypic interactions among various components within the transcription machinery, including RNA Pol II, TFs, and coactivators. These proteins often possess structured domains enabling specific interactions with their partners or with chromatin, alongside intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDRs are predicted to lack stable conformations but are capable of mediating weak and multivalent interactions through various sequence properties
	- Signaling-dependent TFs, such as the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), have been shown to form condensates in response to ligand binding
- Disease
	- gain of condensates
		- proteins often acquire the ability to form condensates on chromatin by fusing an IDR to a DNA/histone-binding domain
		- small insertions and deletions in the histone acetylation reader ENL, identified in Wilms tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), can enhance ENL selfassociation and trigger condensate formation by inducing conformational changes in its well-structured YEATS domain 
		- alterations leading to condensate formation do not have to occur within IDRs
		- changes in localization or expression levels of proteins in cancer can result in a gain of condensates
		- In response to specific stimuli, certain proteins relocate to the nucleus and recruit cofactors, which in turn gives rise to condensate formation. Examples include YAP responding to osmotic stress and the AR responding to androgen signaling
	- loss of condensates
		- Disease-associated mutations can disrupt the formation of naturally occurring condensates involved in nuclear functions. For example, UTX, a histone H3K27 demethylase, relies on condensate formation driven by its IDR for its chromatin activities, and the most frequent cancer mutation of UTX results in the loss of this IDR, leading to impairment of its tumor suppression function (
		- Rett syndrome
	- Alteration of condensate properties 
		- repeat expansions in IDRs of specific TFs (HOXD13)  --> hereditary synpolydactyly. (extra finger)
		- Oncogenic mutations in NPM1, found in ~30% of AML cases, result in a predominantly cytoplasmic localization, with a small fraction of the mutant protein retained in the nucleus. This nuclear mutant NPM1 tends to form condensates at specific genomic loci and enrich various cofactors to drive gene activation
